        <p class="short-description">
            Indian word for culture is ‘Sanskriti’. From time immemorial, Indians have described their culture as ‘Human Culture’ (Manav Dharma/ Sanskriti). It has a universal appeal. The principle of ‘Unity in Diversity’ is the implicit law of nature, universe and life. People belonging to diverse communities, speaking different languages, having different food, performing different customs harmoniously co-exist in India.Over the years, numerous styles of art, architecture, painting, music, dance, festivals and customs have developed in India and this wide variety has made the Indian culture unparalled to which the entire world still looks up to.

            Indian tribal craft is an astounding section in modern Indian times, which slowly has taken in a cosmopolitan appearance. The final get-up that such tribal crafts receive to adorn and deck sophisticated Indian city homes, can perhaps only be described after a thorough admiration. Indian tribal crafts are available in every area of decoration and embellishment, with numerous irresistible choices, heightening one`s urge to buy tribal goods. . Indian tribal crafts verily mirror the lives of their users, their food and its source, their observances to pacify indefinite forces, which incorporate their arts and crafts, music and dance. Some of the numerous tribal crafts manufactured in India include: Antiques, Art, Baskets, Paper Mache, Ceramics, Clock Making, Embroidery, Block Printing, Decorative Painting, Glass Work, Fabric, Furniture, Gifts, Home Décor, Jewellery, Leather Crafts, Metal Crafts, Paper Crafts, Pottery, Puppets, Stone and Wood Works. It is wholly expressed through art and reflects its use in their crafts. Indian tribal craft is generally ritualistic, rubbing off a distinct line between the artist and the art lover.
In Jharkhand State, major crafts of cane & bamboo, terracotta, dolls and toys, tribal jewellery, metalware, textile, tribal paintings are prevalent in the tribal areas but these crafts are lacking development due to awareness, education, and non-availability of technical assistance for promotion of marketing as per the requirement of changing scenario in the international market. Ranchi, Hazribagh, Dhumka and Jameshedpur are the major crafts pockets in Jharkhand where tribal crafts are being practiced and in this pocket. The non-availability of the infrastructure for the development of the crafts sector in Jharkhand and further being a new setup, the promotion of crafts from this area is lacking. In Orissa the crafts of folk painting, metal images, horn and bone products, pottery and clay, brass and bell metal, appliqué, wood work, stone, silver filigree and textiles etc. are the main crafts being practiced..The concentration of the crafts in Orissa is Dhenkanl, Cuttak, Mayurbhanj, Sundergarh, Sambalpur, Koraput, Jaypure, Bharapali, Puri, Behranpur, Narangpur etc.
Orissa, however, is rich in handicrafts but their export is not impressive as their contribution in exports of India is about of 7%. The tribal crafts have potentiality of international marketing but there is lack of opportunity for their showcasing.  Further, there is lack of product diversification, technological upgradation as well as availability of the capital.  Tribal crafts are dependent on the local plant ecosystem.In different state of India  different crafts are prevalent and practicised 
Indian handicrafts is an art of making crafts by hand in India is called Indian handicrafts, in ancient India people lived in colonies called tribals and they were used to make utility items for their daily need, that art of making the crafts called handicrafts, and the items called handicrafts goods. Then people started selling these products in the local markets “haat”. Time has been passed and people have become more developed and civilised in all aspects, those who were making handicraft products have started trading their makings by increasing demand and population. A fashion accessory is an item used to contribute, in a secondary manner, to the wearer's outfit, often used to complete an outfit and chosen to specifically complement the wearer's look.  Fashion accessories and costume jewelry are items that are used to complement fashion. Accessories help highlight address or apparel. They can also help to hide a weakness of a dress.
Trends are continuously set by adding accessories to different outfits. Accessories change an entire look, from handbag to shoes to earrings and beaded necklaces to leg warmers. Accessories may be used as external visual symbols of religious or cultural affiliation: Crucifixes, Jewish stars, Islamic headscarves, skullcaps and turbans are common examples. India is credited as one of the oldest and persistent country for making jewelry around the globe. With its glitter, tradition and latest fashion Indian jewelry entices the whole world in the web of desire to at least own a pricey designed jewelry for life
